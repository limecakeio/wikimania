Wikimania is a single-player browser-game desktop application, implemented using nodeJS, AngularJS as well as the Wikipedia API. The game is intended to be executed using nwJS or a modern Chrome-Browser.

The goal of the game is for a player to reach a so-called "target" page in the least amount of "clicks" possible. The player starts the game from an either pre-selected or randomly generated "starting" page, and attempts to reach the "target" by navigating through Wikipedia articles.

The game features the two game-modes [Easy & Hard], a highscore-feature as well as the ability to "challenge" a previously set highscore by entering the same same start/target game as their predeccesor.

Wikimania - not only fun, but also educational.

Both the group and game are for educational exam-purposes only, and have no association with Wikipedia.
