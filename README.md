Wikimania is a single-player game in which a player starts the game on a random or pre-defined page on Wikipedia with the goal of reaching a random or predefined target page using nothing but the internal wikipedia-links contained within each page. Highscores are dependent on the start/goal pair and the amount of clicks required to get from the origin-page to the goal-page. The lesser pages visited along the way, the higher the position in the hall-of-fame.
